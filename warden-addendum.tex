\title{Warden Addendum}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Summary}
\textbf{Wardens} are active \textbf{Members} who want to become experts of the Hive and lead the Hive mission.
\textbf{Wardens} are able to effectively offer advice, teach users how to properly and safely use the machines, maintain the space, and directly request replacements or improvements to items in the space.
The increased responsibility of these \textbf{Members} comes with the benefit of a rebate towards the \textbf{Membership} fee and direct access to funds for improvement of the space.

\section{Organization}
The \textbf{Chief Operating Officer (COO)} is responsible for managing the \textbf{Wardens}. Duties include, but are not limited to, the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Ensuring that \textbf{Wardens} are respecting the Hive
\item Approval of requests for the Warden Budget
\item Holding short monthly progress meetings with the \textbf{Wardens}
\end{itemize}

\section{Warden Budget}
A total of \$250 is allocated each month, in addition to the compensation given to the \textbf{Wardens}.
\textbf{Wardens} have direct access to request parts/consumables for the Hive out of this Warden Budget.
Approved requests are purchased by the \textbf{COO}, and the monthly summary is presented to the \textbf{Board} at each \textbf{Board Meeting} for reimbursement to the \textbf{COO}.

\section{Eligibility, Rebate, and Appointment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Any \textbf{Member} in good standing for at least the prior \textbf{four (4)} consecutive months may serve as an \textbf{Warden}.
The longevity requirement may be waived for a specific \textbf{Member} by an Act of the \textbf{Board of Directors}.
\item \textbf{Wardens} are eligible for a rebate of 100\% of dues for \textbf{Student Members} and 50\% of dues for any other \textbf{Membership} class.
\item The maximum number of \textbf{Wardens} may be changed at any time by an Act of the Board of Directors, and is \textbf{eight (8)} until such an Act is passed.
Reducing the maximum number of \textbf{Wardens} does not cause any current \textbf{Warden} to be removed from a \textbf{Warden} position.
\item \textbf{Wardens} are appointed and removed by the \textbf{Chief Operating Officer (COO)}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Responsibilities}
Responsibilities of the \textbf{Wardens} include, but are not limited to, the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Provide at least one reliable form of contact plus respond on the \textbf{Mailing List} and any other electronic messaging system the Hive provides for its \textbf{Members}
\item Ensure that the Hive is kept clean
\item Maintain all equipment in the Hive, and ensure broken equipment is repaired
\item Maintain documentation on Hive equipment, including a list of any consumables needed and current status
\item Request Warden Budget funds for parts or consumables as needed
\item Hold public hours at least twice a month for at least two hours each at which the \textbf{Warden} is present
\item Provide feedback on how to improve the \textbf{Warden} program
\end{itemize}

\section{Areas}
The COO is responsible for determining the specific breakdown of the various \textbf{Areas} and the individual duties of each \textbf{Warden}.
Each \textbf{Warden} is not necessarily limited to one Area, nor one \textbf{Warden} per Area, and cross-training of \textbf{Wardens} is encouraged.\\
Until such time as the \textbf{COO} changes the various Areas, they are as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item CNC Machining

\item Metalworking
\item Digital Fabrication Lounge (CAD/3D Printing/Laser Cutters)
